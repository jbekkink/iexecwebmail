# Description 
This marketing dapp allows users to protect their emails and files, grant access to contacts, and send emails to their contacts. 
When sending an email, users can filter the contacts based on the pool. This app currently has 3 pools (could be expanded in the future), namely the AI Pool, NFT pool and DeFi pool.

# Pools 
The pools are based on the Coinmarketcap (cmc) categories/tags. Whenever a user in the contact list has any token that also has the cmc tag, it gets added to the relevant pool.
