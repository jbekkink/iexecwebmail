# Description 
This marketing dapp allows users to protect their emails and files, grant access to contacts, and send emails to their contacts. 
When sending an email, users can filter the contacts based on the pool. This app currently has 3 pools (could be expanded in the future), namely the AI Pool, NFT pool and DeFi pool. 

Important: To run this app locally you will need to use your own keys for walletconnect (update this in _app.tsx), and an alchemy token api key (update this in SendEmail.js)
